        package.json            // everytime you need a new devDependency add it here
        tsconfig.json           // every package from the monorepo that you import you need to add it to references
    storybook/                  // storybook that will run all the components
        stories/                // feel free to add more components in this folder

            button/
                index.tsx
                index.stories.tsx
        package.json            // everytime you need a new devDependency add it here
        tsconfig.json           // every package from the monorepo that you import you need to add it to references
    header/                     // a header component
    button/                     // a button component
package.json                    // everytime you need a new devDependency add it here
tsconfig.json                   // everytime you add a new package modify this file by adding the new package path
```
## Typescript references

Every time you add a new package you must do the following

1. Add to root tsconfig.json the path of the new package
2. If this package is a dependency of another package you also need to add it to the parent tsconfig.json file

WIP: Create an automatic way of creating the project references
